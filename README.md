Labor-Econ-Data-Management-HW-Example
=====================================

This repository contains the files used to complete an assignment for a graduate-level course I completed en route to earning my MS in Economics.  The main analysis is conducted via STATA.  The assignment document "Homework 1.docx" was created by the course Professor, and has only been altered to remove any information that could be used by future students to identify the course and instructor.  The data files "PSID2003.dta", "PSID2005.dta", and "hhlink_ex.dta" were also provided.  The repository contains the following items:

1. Homework 1.docx is the original assignment document details.
2. HW1_Ackerman.do is the main STATA .do file that executes the required analysis to answer the questions in the assignment.
3. HW1_Ackerman.log is a STATA .log file that details the successful execution of 2.
4. PSID2003.dta is a STATA .dta file containing the supplied 2003 PSID public survey data
5. PSID2005.dta is a STATA .dta file containing the supplied 2005 PSID public survey data
6. hhlink_ex.dta is a STATA .dta file that links the two files by matching household ID's. 

Note: Files have been scrubbed of all course identification information.
